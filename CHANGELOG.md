# Change Log

## Version 1.4.3 - 2025-08-24

- Cleaner error message when failing to decode latex from input files
  (issue [#20](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/issues/20)).

## Version 1.4.2 - 2025-06-07

- Fix an error when calling `load_entry` via the python API.

## Version 1.4.1 - 2025-03-03

- Deprecate `-n / --no-color` option, replace it with `--color <auto|always|force>`
  and environment variables.

## Version 1.4.0 - 2024-10-27

- Add command-line tab completion for flags and some choices (field names)
- Simplify and documents ways to call this script from python
- Fix 404 warnings on DOI not found for crossref
- Add `--sf --start-from` flag and clarify message shown on interrupt, plus show
  instructions on how to resume. Also display a hint that BTAC can be interrupted
  after 5 minutes if less than half of all entries are completed (issue
  [#18](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/issues/18)).
- Progress bar now only show the number of completed entries, not queries
  (discussion [#17](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/discussions/17)
  and issue [#19](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/issues/19))
- Skip queries to sources if they lag behind (>=10 queries remain or >=60s
  delay between queries) when 2/3rds of the other sources have completed. This
  avoids having a single source slow down btac considerably. Add the
  `--ns --no-skip` flag to disable this behavior.

## Version 1.3.3 - 2024-08-07

- No longer set URL fields to `https://dx.doi.org/<doi>`, instead use this to
  complete the doi field (issue [#14](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/issues/14))
- New flag `-u --copy-doi-to-url` to do the reverse, set the URL field (if absent)
  to the DOI.
- Now writes all entries to a temporary file on keyboard interrupt (Ctrl-C) to
  avoid data loss
- Fix 404 warnings on DOI not found for unpaywall
- Fix URL escape missing in path (issue [#16](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/issues/16))
- Fix duplicate silent flag ignored
- Fix application crash when combining authors (issue [#16](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/issues/16))
- Fix interaction between `--escape-unicode` and `--protect-uppercase` options
- Protect uppercase option now also protects unicode uppercase
- Fix using the `--fa` / `--align-values` option leading to empty output

## Version 1.3.2 - 2024-04-12

- Add `-b --filter-fields-by-entrytype` option (issue [#13](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/issues/13)).
- Fix `-c / -C` flags only filtering queries and not results since 1.3.0
- Fix output of some error messages not displaying entry ID

## Version 1.3.1 - 2024-02-20

- Add `-D --diff` flag
- Changes to verbose mode output:
  - display per source query counter under the
    progress bar (hoping to make this even prettier once
    https://github.com/rsalmei/alive-progress/issues/188 gets resolved)
  - display source list on a new line in final output
- Fix a new error occurring when checking DOIs (issue [#12](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/issues/12))
- Officially support python 3.12
- Build system change: now using `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.py` and
  [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) instead of black, isort and flake8.

## Version 1.3.0 - 2024-02-05

- Add https://openalex.org/ as a source
- Add https://inspirehep.net/ as a source
- Switch entry merging strategy from "pick from the first source" to a majority
  vote between the sources. Added advanced normalization and smart merge for each field:
  - Authors (and editors) match if they have same last names and, if both first
    names present, the first name of one is equal/an abbreviation of the other.
    Author list match if their intersection is non-empty.
  - Check ISSN and ISBN format and checksums. Convert ISBN to 13 digit version
  - Check URL and DOI format, validate them by querying them online to ensure they
    exist
  - Many fields match with abbreviation detection (journal, institution, booktitle,
    organization, publisher, school and series)
  - Pages format normalized to use `--` as separator
  - All other fields match excluding case and punctuation.
- Add new field formatting option:
  - `--fu/--escape-unicode` to replace unicode character with latex encoding
  - `--fpa/--protect-all-uppercase` or `--fp/--protect-uppercase <field>` or
    `--FP/--dont-protect-uppercase <field>` to protect words containing uppercase
    letters with braces `{` and `}` in the given fields
- Fix 404 warning on DOIs not found in semantic-scholar and others
- Remove researchr author disambiguation numbers (it would sometimes return
  `John Doe 0002`, which you don't want in your file)
- Fix author names with `von` prefix not formatted correctly
- Fix author names with capitalized prefix (`De`, `Von`, ...) not formatted correctly
- Fix `btac` removing capital-preserving brackets and converting to unicode in
  user supplied fields (issue [#11](https://github.com/dlesbre/bibtex-autocomplete/issues/11)).

## Version 1.1.8 - 2023-02-27
